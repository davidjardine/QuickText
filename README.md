# QuickText
A web development framework using only plain HTML/CSS meant for beginners and advanced users to more easily create fully accessible sites without compromising on accessibility

The name QuickText is a play on the first two letters in HTTP (HyperText). QuickText is a fast and simple system of templates for making simple, responsive, beautiful, and ACCESSIBLE websites with only plain HTML/CSS.

## Purpose

The goal is to make web development easier to learn and for more accessible websites to become common. Written and documented with beginners in mind, but useful for advanced web developers to reconsider the frameworks they may be used to in favour of good old plain HTML/CSS sites.  

There are too many websites that implement complex and resource-heavy frameworks to accomplish layouts or designs that are not only possible but easy with only CSS. This project aims to make it easier for anyone to get to that point.  

### Accessibility

While there are many great new developments in web accessibility that make even the fanciest of JS frameworks accessible, nothing will beat the universality of properly structured HTML. Achieving your desired site layout with only HTML/CSS may not have been possible at the dawn of the web but modern CSS means that you don't have to sacrifice on design in order to ensure maximum accessibility (though of course there will always be an edge case, and when you can't achieve both then accessibility should **always** come before aesthetics).  

### Aesthetics and Design

Websites used to be fun and personal, showing off the personality of the individual behind the site. As the internet got more complicated it got harder to build your own customized site that would compete with the fancier ones available from big companies or entities. This lead to simpler templates being used and everyone's sites looking the same.  

Lately there have been more voices calling for a return to the individuality of the old-school internet, but there are more barriers to just creating even a plain HTML/CSS site than before. Most of these address accessibility concerns with early websites and should not be ignored as we try to restore individuality to the web. QuickText templates take care of, or offer significant help in, implementing things that would take several hours of studying to understand for a beginner.  

It isn't important that anyone with a website understands exactly how a screen-reader will parse your DOM, but it is important that everyone's website is easily parsed by any accessibility device. QuickText templates provide this base level of accessibility and also guides the developer on maintaining accessibility as design and aesthetic choices are implemented.  

### Speed

QuickText certainly isn't meant to improve upon the speeds of HTML but instead aims to return us to the original speeds we've sacrificed for fancy layouts and web apps. HTML, CSS, and the whole HTTP protocol were designed to deliver content as fast as possible from server to the user's computer. Huge advancements in technology have given us the freedom to build ever-increasing levels of complexity into websites and not notice significant performance drops.  

The cost of complex web apps may be invisible to the user, but the illusion of it being free is bad for the user and for the internet at large. The web needs to move back to its roots of being as lightweight as possible and that is QuickText's goal. Just because the average user's computer can load a site built with multiple JS frameworks it doesn't mean we should be doing that.  

In a world where everything is less stable, from internet connections being cut (deliberately or otherwise) to the countless communities that for geographic or political reasons have never had reliable internet it isn't a given that users will have a fibre gigabit connection that can handle a thousand calls to your back end.  

Speed also refers to the time it takes to learn how to implement the code, and complex frameworks are not beginner friendly. Growing up with customizable personal websites like Tumblr, Geocities, and MySpace showed how easy it is to pick up HTML and CSS just by playing around now and then with it in your browser, but you can't just casually pick up Angular or NodeJS. You need to first download the environment to run it and that's already more of a barrier than the average person cares to overcome. Making it quick and simple to even accidentally learn is key to re-opening the internet for everyone to participate in.
